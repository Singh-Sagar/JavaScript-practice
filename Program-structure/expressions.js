//  expressions are similer to atoms in context of a program
// example of expression
const x = true;
y = 10; // bad practice

// bindings are tentacles not boxes. two bindings can refer to the same value
console.log(y);

// function calling is also called as function invoking
// Values given to function are called arguments
// Prompt is a lesser used funtion in the modern javascript landscape
